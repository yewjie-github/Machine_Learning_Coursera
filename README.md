Below is a list of Machine Learning concepts that I have learnt and implemented using Octave throughout this 11-week program:

1. Linear Regression
2. Logistic Regression
3. Multi-class Classfication
4. Neural Networks
  * Backpropagation
  * Visualizing the hidden layer
5. Regularized Linear Regression
6. Bias-variance
7. Polynomial Regression
8. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
9. Spam Classification
10. K-means Clustering
11. Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
12. Anomaly Detection
13. Recommender Systems

*Details to each concept will be covered in subsequent section.*
