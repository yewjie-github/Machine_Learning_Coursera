Hear the latest best practices in cross-border e-commerce logistics


Dear Yew,

On October 5, the Global Supply Chain Council (GSCC) will organize the Cross-Border E-Commerce Logistics Forum in Singapore. This compact half-day event will cover different topics related to cross-border e-commerce logistics, warehousing and last mile delivery through case studies and personal stories from a great line-up of speakers.

The rise of e-commerce in Singapore has already had massive implications for the country's logistics system and property market. Now, this change is coming to bonded zones in the region, as cross-border online shopping offers a way for Singapore-based consumers to safely buy from foreign countries, eliminating uncertainty related to after-service, tax burdens, customs clearance and delivery times.

Confirmed speakers and panellists include:
- Marco De Lorenzo, Co-Founder & Chief Commercial Officer, Zyllem NEW!
- Dr. Arne Jeroschewski, Founder & CEO, Parcel Perform NEW!
- Yong Shen Tam, Cross-Border Business Development, eBay
- Mike Ghasemi, Research Director, Retail Insights, IDC Asia/Pacific
- Vaibhav Dabhade, Founder & CEO, Anchanto
- Sushil Verma, Director, International Logistics, Pitney Bowes
- Syed Ali Ridha Madihid, Managing Director, iCommerce Asia
- Aaron Michael, Logistics and Business Executive
- and more to be confirmed soon...
